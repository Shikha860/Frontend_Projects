     <p class="textsecond">It is rightly said we learn more when we learn together. Learning and growing together would be an effective way to form powerful relationships and create a healthy, supportive atmosphere. This kind of atmosphere encourages people to work together, trust each other, and treat each other with respect.It also helps people be creative, come up with new ideas, and solve problems. In a place where people learn and grow together, everyone adds to the group’s wisdom and communicates their thoughts and feelings, ideas, and skills. This makes people feel like they are part of a group because everyone has a role in contributing to the entire process of learning as a whole</p>

     <p class="textsecond2">Education is very important for the development of the country. It helps in the economic development of the country. Education can change the life of a person. Former president of India Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam is the best example of how education can change the life of a person.The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….

    We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a 21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…</p>

     <p class="textfirst2">Eassy on New Education Policy</p>
     <p class="textsecond3">A New Education Policy has been sanctioned by our government in July 2020; after a gap of 34 years, for bringing the changes in the National Education System. The New Education Policy has its objective of making the learning process more efficient by enhancing students thinking and creative ability. The New Education Policy includes several changes in the school level as well as higher education. These essays on the New Education Policy will help you to understand in detail about this subjectThe earlier system of education was basically focused on learning and giving results. The students were judged by the marks attained. This was a unidirectional approach to development. But the new education policy focuses on the relevance of a multi-disciplinary approach. It aims at all-round development of the student.
     New education policy visualizes the formation of a new curriculum and structure of education which will help the students at their different stages of learning. The change has to be done in the existing education system in order to make education reach up to all, ranging from urban to rural areas. It will be towards meeting sustainability by fulfilling Goal 4- Quality Education.</p>
